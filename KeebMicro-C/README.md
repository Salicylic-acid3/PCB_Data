# KeebMicro-C

The KeebMicro-C is a Pro Micro compatible microcontroller board designed for DIY mechanical keyboards in Japan.
It is based on the same Atmel ATMega32U4 chip and can be programmed using Arduino IDE or keyboard-specific firmware such as TMK or QMK.
Conthrough, commonly used in Japan, eliminates the need for soldering.
